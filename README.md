# Connect N

## Proposal
This application is intended to be a custom version of the popular children's game Connect 4. This version of the
game will allow for custom board size and multiple games to be played at once.
The target demographic for this application is people
who are looking for a nostalgic game, but are perhaps too bored of the original (since it never changes!)
This project is of interest to me because I have created small CLI games before, but have not gone
into anything with a desktop GUI.

## User Stories
As a user, I want to be able to add a piece on the board (either color) \
As a user, I want to be able to add a new game to the list of open games \
As a user, I want to be able to view all the current open games \
As a user, I want to be able to remove a game from the list of open games
